Practical Work on Sorting Methods
This project aims to implement and analyze the performance of six sorting algorithms for the Algorithms and Data Structures 2 course.

Each algorithm has its own characteristics and efficiencies, varying according to the size and nature of the data to be sorted.

The algorithms implemented in this project are applied to sort a list of NBA players, considering different sorting criteria. The performance of each method is evaluated based on execution time, number of comparisons, and number of movements performed during sorting.

The sorting algorithms implemented are briefly described below:

Bubble Sort:
A simple sorting algorithm that compares adjacent pairs of elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed.

Heap Sort:
A sorting algorithm based on a data structure called heap (partially ordered binary tree). The algorithm builds a maximum heap and then extracts the maximum element, rebuilds the heap, and repeats this process until all elements are sorted.

Insertion Sort:
A sorting algorithm that iteratively inserts each element of the list into the correct position, comparing it with the already sorted elements to its left.

Quick Sort:
A divide-and-conquer-based sorting algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the list around the pivot, placing all elements smaller than the pivot to the left and all larger elements to the right. This process is applied recursively to the resulting sublists.

Selection Sort:
A sorting algorithm that iteratively selects the smallest (or largest) element from the list and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

Merge Sort:
A divide-and-conquer-based sorting algorithm that splits the list into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the sorted halves into a single sorted list.
